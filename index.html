        <p>
          Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
          kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football
          normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
          word is used. Sports commonly called football include association
          football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron
          football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
          Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby
          league); and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to
          varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
